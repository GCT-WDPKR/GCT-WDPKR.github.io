# Pruning 

Deadwooding 
- Deadwooding consists of removing dead, damaged, or broken branches, and crossed branches (branches that overlap, rub against each other, and are likely to break in the future).

Crown thinning 
- A reasonable thinning consists of deadwooding plus the removal of "badly oriented" branches (for example, towards the inside of the crown¹) to have a more harmonious crown with more light passing through.

Crown lifting 
- Or crown raising is the removal of low branches to create a less cluttered more accessible space around the tree. 

Crown reduction 
- Reduction or drop-crotching, allows the volume of the tree to be maintained where space is limited. As a matter of principle, you should always leave a 'sap drawing branch'² of adequate size.

Fruit pruning 
- This tends to vary according to the species but shares the aim of producing as much good quality fruit as possible. 

Removing caterpillar nests 
- Pine or Oak processionary caterpillars can be devastating to a tree's leaf mass. Moreover, their hair can cause severe iritance for us, our children, and our pets. Removal and eradication of the nests are the most efficient means of controlling these pests. 

Pollarding 
- Pollarding is an old technique implemented to heavily restrain the tree's development. Pollarded trees require regular pruning, every two to three years. 

¹ Crown - is the structured group of branches at the top of the trunk.
² Sap drawing branch - is a branch left after a cut which, as its name suggests, draws sap to the wound. This will facilitate recovery and reduce the number of new shoots. The appropriate size for such a branch is at least a third of the diameter of the cut branch. 

# Felling

Direct
- When the tree felling is achievable from its base. 

Section felled - free fall
- Carried out when simple felling is unsafe and the tree must be dismantled from its crown.

Section felled - rigged
- When the constraints around the tree require fall management.
