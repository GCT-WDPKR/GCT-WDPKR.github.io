**Rigged limb removal**

**Serveral types of prunning and the felling of a hazrdous tree** 

{% include gallery id="gallery_four" caption="Storm damage resulted in the removal of one of the Scots Pines and the *deadwooding* of the other, along with the oak. Hard *crown reduction* of the hazel and *crown thinning* for the apple tree in the understory resulted in a safer, brighter, and more harmonious garden." %}
